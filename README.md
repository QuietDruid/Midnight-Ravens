# Midnight Ravens
CLI game written in C# for a game development class. Heavily inspired by the game Duskers, where you're aboard a scrapping ship in space and have to survive as long as possible with the supplies you have and the ships you scrap with your drones. 

Initial game functions/templates are in place but further development is needed for this proof of concept
